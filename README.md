Description
The favorites.js file is responsible for retrieving favorite recipes stored in the browser's localStorage and displaying them on the "Favorites" page. It dynamically creates recipe cards for each favorite recipe and appends them to the recipe list section.

Usage
Include the favorites.js file in the HTML file of the "Favorites" page where favorite recipe display functionality is required.
Ensure that the HTML element with the ID recipeList is present in the HTML file to enable dynamic content insertion.
The script listens for the DOMContentLoaded event and retrieves favorite recipes from localStorage.
It then calls the displayFavoriteRecipes() function to display the favorite recipes on the page.
Each favorite recipe is rendered as a recipe card with its title, image, calories, ingredients, and instructions (if available).
